# Drop Bear Table

## Overview
Drop Bear Table is a web application designed to make table reservations at restaurants online. This project was created as a part of my software development portfolio to demonstrate my ability to work across the full web tech stack and learn both new technologies and concepts as I go.

In terms of a general overview, the project was made using MongoDB, Express.js, Vue 3, and Node.js. There is full CRUD functionality implemented in terms of both restaurants and reservations, with authorisation and authentication handled through the use of JWTâ€™s and three distinct user groups.

If you have any questions about the project, or simply would like to know more about it, please feel free to get in contact with me.
